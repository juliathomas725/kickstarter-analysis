## Overview of Project
This project pulled past Kickstarter data to analyze the outcomes of campaigns across categories, outcomes, and dates that campaigns began and ended. 

### Purpose ###
The purpose of this project is to provide insight into the most successful Kickstarter campaigns. This project is looking at the best time of year to begin a Kickstarter campaign, what goals have seen the highest success rate, and which campaigns had the most success given their Parent Category – Theater and Subcategory – Plays. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date ###
Based on the analysis of when theater Kickstarter campaigns were started, it can be concluded based on the data given, that the two most successful months to begin a theater campaign would be either May or June. As seen in the accompanying graph, May and June had the highest number of theater campaigns, but the number of successful campaigns that began was almost two times those which had failed. December and January had the fewest number of successful campaigns launched when compared to failed campaigns. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals ###
The analysis of successful and failed campaigns based on campaign goals shows that the highest percentage of successful campaigns had goals of less than $1000. 76% of those campaigns were successful, which is the highest percentage out of all monetary categories. Campaigns with goals of between $35000 and $44999 were the second highest successful goal categories with 67% of those campaigns being successful. However, there were far fewer of those campaigns when compared to other monetary categories and therefore should be considered outliers. As shown in the Outcomes Based on Goals graph, about half of the campaigns were successful when the goal was set between $1000 and $4999, $5000 to $9999, and $10000 and $14999. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered ###
Further analysis of live Kickstarter campaigns could be made to offer insight as to the present time and how successful each goal is projected to be. Additionally, analysis post-2020 could be insightful. Given the data, it is difficult to say definitively which Campaign Goal would be guaranteed to succeed. However, the above categories based on this 

## Results ##
Based on the analysis of both campaign launch dates and goals, the conclusion could be made that a Kickstarter theater campaign has the best chance of success if it is launched in May or June and has a goal of less than $10000. The probability that it would be successful is the greatest given this current analysis.
